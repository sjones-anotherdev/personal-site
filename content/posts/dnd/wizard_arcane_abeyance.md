At level 10, your Chronurgy Wizard gets access to Arcane Abeyance. Conceptually, you just make a mote of magic energy and you get to cast it later. For most spells, this doesn't have much usage, but, in fact, this a potentially broken feature.

# Spell Description
"__Arcane Abeyance__  
_10th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_  
When you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell’s magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the spell is lost.  
A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes.  
Once you create a bead with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest."
# Feature Use-Cases
## Quick Cast Spells
While most spells only take 1 action - 6 seconds - and a cycle of triggering _Arcane Abeyance_ and using the mote takes 2 actions, you can greatly decrease spell cast times for spells that take longer 2 actions. For example, you could cast a spell as a ritual out of combat, trigger _Arcane Abeyance_, and then activate the mote in combat.  
__Example__:
1. Cast [Leomund's Tiny Hut](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut), preferably as a ritual out of combat.
2. Trigger _Arcane Abeyance_ to condense the spell into a mote.
3. During combat, activate the mote to create what is essentially an 8 hour safezone for your party.

## Find Familiar Party Wide
Assuming your party isn't all wizards, you probably all don't have familiars, despite their wide in and out of combat usage. Normally [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar) needs to be in your spell list or you need to take a feat. However, by casting [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar) once per short rest and triggering _Arcane Abeyance_, you can pass off the mote to another player, causing them to be treated as the spellcaster. By using the next method, you can even do it within the span of one short rest, without dependancy on party size. 

## Semi-Infinite Out-of-Combat Spell Usage
Found in the God Wizard is Dead2 guide, you can have semi-infinite casts of a spell under 4th level using this method:  

1. Cast your spell of choice and trigger _Arcane Abeyance_
2. Cast [Wristpocket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wristpocket) and target the mote
3. Activate the mote to release the spell
4. Trigger [Wristpocket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wristpocket) to summon it to your freehand

Every spell cast costs 2 actions total and casting [Wristpocket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wristpocket) takes another. _Arcane Abeyance_ expires after an hour. This leaves 299 total cycles of disappearing and resummoning. Unfortunately, since it takes 2 actions total, this isn’t typically viable for in-combat.
